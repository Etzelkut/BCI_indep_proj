Into Paradigm-Independent Brain Computer Interfaces

In this paper, we conducted the experiment and proposed a network, which can classify the paradigm. After the model classified the paradigm of the input data, classic and powerful techniques can be used in the classification of the action inside the paradigm. Results are particularly encouraging, but more research with heavier computational resources can yield more general results.

Code will be added later after getting approval from other team members and professors. It also will be updated with a better result. Check it on the 15th of January (2021).

Sorry, new date, check it on the end of 18th of January (2021).
