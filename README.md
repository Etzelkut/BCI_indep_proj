Into Paradigm-Independent Brain Computer Interfaces

In this paper, we conducted the experiment and proposed a network, which can classify the paradigm. After the model classified the paradigm of the input data, classic and powerful techniques can be used in the classification of the action inside the paradigm. Results are particularly encouraging, but more research with heavier computational resources can yield more general results.
